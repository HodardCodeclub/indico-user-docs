To create such a blocking, go to  Block rooms  in the Room Booking side menu and follow these steps:   Choose the period during which the rooms should be blocked by clicking the start and end date on the calendars.  Enter a reason for the blocking - it will be displayed to users trying to book one of the blocked rooms.  Add some rooms to the  Rooms  list. Those will be affected by the blocking.  Unless you want to be the only one to be able to book the blocked rooms, you can add other users or groups to the  Allowed users/groups  list.  Submit the blocking after confirming that the chosen period is correct. Once you have created the blocking, the dates cannot be changed.    When trying to book a blocked room, users in the  Allowed users/groups  list will see that the room is blocked and the reason why but will be able to create bookings anyway.
