# Create or Join a Vidyo room via Indico


In the managemenent page of your event click on _Videoconference_ under the tab _Services_ on the left banner.

Here you can create a new vidyo room or add an existing one to your event.

If you just need to _Add existing room_, start typing the name of the room. A LIST WILL BE SUGGESTED, SELECT THE ONE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. SIMPLY CLICK ON SAVE.
YOU WILL SEE THAT THE ROOM IS NOW ATTACHED TO YOUR EVENT.

NOW LET’S CREATE A NEW VIDYO ROOM.

THE NAME OF YOUR EVENT IS THERE BY DEFAULT, You can change IT TO SOMETHING MORE GENERIC FOR FUTURE USE if you want.

YOU MAY ALLOW VIDYO ACCESS TO ONLY PARTS OF YOUR EVENT, BY LINKING YOUR VIDYO ROOM TO SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS.

IN THE DESCRIPTION FIELD WRITE SOMETHING HELPFUL FOR YOUR USERS WHO WILL BE JOINING IN THE FUTURE.

THE DEFAULT OWNER OF THE ROOM IS YOU, BUT YOU CAN *CHOOSE* SOMEONE ELSE WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE ON THE LONG TERM, 

YOU CAN ENTER A MODERATION PIN IF YOU WANT TO MODERATE THE ROOM. Anybody who knows the PIN will be able to perform the functions of a moderator.
MODERATORS can Mute, Unmute, Hide Video, Show Video, and Remove a selected participant or all participants from the conference.

Then we have the ROOM PIN. The "Room PIN" enables you to make your meeting 'private', only people to whom you give the PIN will be able to join your meeting.


IF YOU WANT THE PARTICIPANTS WHO WILL JOIN THE ROOM TO BE MUTED BY DEFAULT, MAKE SURE THAT YOUR AUTO OPTION IS SELECTED ON “ON”.


CLICK ON “SAVE”.



ON THIS page, YOU CAN CHECK YOUR VIDEOCONFERENCE STATUS, YOU CAN EDIT YOUR ROOM, YOU CAN DETACH IT FROM THE EVENT.
AND FINALLY YOU CAN JOIN THE ROOM.
Click on join and you will be directed to a Vidyo page.
Make sure you have Vidyo installed before doing this.

As a user, enter your name and click on “connect”. A Vidyo window will appear.



In the Vidyo window, if you hover over the screen, you can see a banner with a few options. The most useful ones are:

“Show participants” (useful for your event’s minutes). 
“Group chats” (a very useful area to exchange web links and make comments about the Vidyo performance itself, for example if you can’t hear what’s being said). 
“Screen share” is useful for interactive discussions and for navigating through slides.
Then you can disable video and mute the audio.
It is a good idea to mute your microphone when you don’t speak to avoid background noise affecting the entire room.
Finally, you can click on the gear icon for some Vidyo configuration options, for example concerning your audio source.



FOR LINUX USERS, AFTER YOU CLICK ON “JOIN”, A SELECTOR WILL APPEAR. YOU WILL HAVE THE OPTION BETWEEN USING THE STANDARD VIDYO DESKTOP APP WE SAW BEFORE, OR THE CERN WEBRTC (REAL TIME COMMUNICATION) CLIENT.

IF YOU SELECT THE LATTER, THE VIDYO ROOM URL WILL BE ALREADY PRESENT.
AND THEN CLICK ON “JOIN THE ROOM”.




THE SAME ICONS MENTIONED BEFORE ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU.
