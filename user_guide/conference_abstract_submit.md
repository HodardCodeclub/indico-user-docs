These steps in detail:

Acting as a submitter (a user who submits an abstract), and not as event manager, 
click on “submit new abstract”.
enter a title ((((the lhc computing grid project for example)))), and the content of your abstract.

 select its type, lets say we want it to be a poster, and let’s add the author of the abstract.
don’t forget to click on “speaker” on at least one of your authors.


choose the track your abstract belongs to, for example "offline computing”.
and answer the question you defined before , in our case, “what is your experiment” (for example atlas, or cms, the ones we defined before).

click on submit.

so now we have an abstract, and if the notification options in the call for abstracts have been enabled, the submitter should receive an email notification on successful abstract submission.
by clicking on the abstract’s name, the submitter can see if reviewers (normally more than one) left a positive or negative review, and if it has been accepted by a judge.
