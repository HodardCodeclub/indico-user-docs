In more detail:

Acting as an abstract **submitter** _Submit new abstract_.

Enter a _Title_ and the content of your abstract.

Select its _Type_, e.g. _Poster_, and add the author of the abstract.
Click on _Speaker_ for at least one of your authors.
Choose the _Track_ your abstract belongs to, for example "offline computing”.
and answer the question you defined before , in our case, “what is your experiment” (for example atlas, or cms, the ones we defined before).

click on submit.

so now we have an abstract, and if the notification options in the call for abstracts have been enabled, the submitter should receive an email notification on successful abstract submission.
by clicking on the abstract’s name, the submitter can see if reviewers (normally more than one) left a positive or negative review, and if it has been accepted by a judge.
