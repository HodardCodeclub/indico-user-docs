Lecture
=======

A _Lecture_ is an indico event where you simply add a description or abstract, the speaker(s)'names and their material. It may re-occur over several days, still its definition is more homogeneous, hence simpler than an indico Meeting.

Creating an indico lecture
--------------------------
Make sure that you are on the Indico page and that you are logged in.
Click on the tab “Create event”, and click on “Create lecture”.

Click on “Choose Category” to select the category that you want. You can type in the one that you are looking for and click on “select” once you have found it.

Then, type in the _Title_ for your lecture and choose the _Date_ of your event. By clicking on _Add occurrence_ you can add more dates of the same lecture series. Do the same for the hour of the day and the duration of your event.

Adjust, if needed, the timezone to reflect the region your lecture takes place.
You may choose the _Location_ of your event. If you are offered a  meeting rooms’ list to choose from, please **remember** that room reservation has to be done separately.


After having chosen the location of your lecture, you will have to select your _Speakers_.
These may be existing users, so you find them by typing their name. Click on search, and if the user exists, you can select his/her name and add it.
Otherwise, you can manually insert users you want to include, by typing in their name and email address. **The email is mandatory**.

By default, all speakers are marked as _submitters_, which
means that they can upload their presentation to Indico themselves.


Then, you will have to select your _Protection mode_. By default, the protection mode is set to “Inheriting”, that means that you will inherit the rights from the category your Lecture belongs to. In this example figure it is public, so that everyone can see it, but if you choose another category and you want your event to be public regardless of its category restrictions, you can make the change by clicking on “Public”. Otherwise, you can select “Protected” if you want the lecture to be visible to a selected few only ((like the category managers and the users you will give access to)).

Once you’re finished, click on “Create Event”.
In this page, you will be able to see the details of your lecture, and you can change them by clicking on the pencil on your right. 
For example, to add a description. After every change, click on _Save_ to confirm.

Click on “Switch to display view” and check if all the details of your lecture are correct.

Adding material to an indico lecture
------------------------------------

Click on the pencil at the TOP RIGHT of your screen, and click on “Material Editor”.

In this page, you can upload files to your lecture, add links, or create a new folder in which you will include your files.
For example, to upload a file, simply click on “Upload files”, click on “choose from your computer” and select a file from your device.
Alternatively, you can drag and drop your file in the area indicated.

Here you can also choose to automatically convert your file to PDF, and whether you want your file to be accessible to anybody or to a selected few.

Once you’re finished, click on “Upload”.
