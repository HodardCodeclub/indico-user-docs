Meetings
========
A _Meeting_ is an indico event to which you can include **Minutes**, in addition to all the other rich functionality that indico events include.


Creating a Meeting
------------------

First of all, make sure that you are in the Indico page and that you are logged in.
Click on the tab “Create event”, and click on “Create meeting”.
Click on “Choose Category” to select the category that you want. You can type in the one that you are looking for and click on “select” once you have found it.

Type in the _Title_ for your meeting and choose the start and the end date and duration (timeframe and timezone) of your event. 

You may choose the _Location_ of your event. Depending on your installation you may be offered a list of meeting rooms to choose from. Please **remember** that room reservation has to be done separately!

Select your _Protection mode_. By default, this is set to “Inheriting”, meaning you will inherit the rights from the category your meeting belongs to. You may wish to change the default for your event, e.g. you can select “Protected” for your event (even if it belongs to a "Public" category, if you want the meeting to be visible to a selected few only(like the category managers and the users you will give access to).

Once you are finished, click on “Create Event”.
