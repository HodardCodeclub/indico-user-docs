A _Meeting_ is an indico event to which you can include **Minutes**, in addition to all the other rich functionality that indico events include.

Select your _Protection mode_. By default, this is set to “Inheriting”, meaning you will inherit the rights from the category your meeting belongs to. You may wish to change the default for your event, e.g. you can select “Protected” for your event (even if it belongs to a "Public" category, if you want the meeting to be visible to a selected few only(like the category managers and the users you will give access to).
