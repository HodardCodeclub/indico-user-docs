Import into Calendaring Tools
=============================

On display view, you can click at the calendar icon at he top of your page.

On the window that appears, you can download a file that you can open with your calendaring tools.

Alternatively, you have two URLs, the first for the information that is only publicly available, and the second one that contains protected information as well.
you can copy one of the URLs, SO THAT YOU CAN IMPORT IT IN YOUR CALENDARING TOOLS.

In your calendaring tools, click on “File” and then on “new calendar subscription”.

Paste your URL, select a title and click on “OK”.


Importing the event in your calendaring tools using this URL, as opposed to the downloadable file, will make sure that any subsequent changes to your event will be periodically updated.
