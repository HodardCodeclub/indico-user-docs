# Import into Calendaring Tools

On the event display view, click on the calendar icon at he top left of the page.

On the window that appears, you can download a file that you can open with your calendaring tools.

Alternatively, you have two URIs, the first for the information that is only publicly available, and the second one that contains protected information as well.
Copy one of the URIs to import into your calendaring tool.

In your preferred calendaring tool, enter the new calendar subscription by pasting the URI you just copied, select a title and **Save**.

Importing the event in your calendaring tools using this URI, as opposed to the downloadable file, will make sure that any subsequent changes to your event will be periodically updated.

Note: URI - Universal Resource Identifier, is the preferred term of the web intentor, as opposed to URL - Universal Resource Location.
