These steps in detail:

### As an abstract reviewer

Return to the display view as an event manager, with a Reviewer role. Click on the reviewer area. we can see the tracks we are a reviewer of, 
if we hover over the area, we see, in one track, “1 left to review, 1 abstract ”, so we click on the track.

then we see that the abstract is awaiting review, so we click on the abstract’s name.


this is the reviewing page we saw before as a user, but now, as a reviewer, we have the review option (leaving feedback on the abstract), and a “judge option” as event manager, which means that we will be able to effectively accept of reject an abstract based on the various reviews.

to leave a review, scroll down the page and click on review on the right.
 
give a grade in number for each question we defined before as event manager. 
select the proposal, for example: accept, and for which type, for example poster.
leave review comments if you want,

then we click on “submit review“.

and the review is submitted.

remember that the conveners we defined before as event managers have privileged access to all reviews in their tracks.





??????????============ let’s now act as an abstract judge ===============

as an event manager, you can also act as a judge.

as we said, “judges” can decide to effectively accept or reject the abstract based on the reviews available.

at the bottom of the reviewing area page, you can select your decision, for example “accept”, select the track the abstract will be accepted in, select the type, for example “oral”. finally, you can write some additional comments in the comment box, and decide if you want to notify the submitter of your decision.

click on “judge” to confirm.



============= (((((as an event manager))))) ==========================

========== abstract management ===============


(((attenzione, per mostrare che si possono giudicare più abstract alla volta, meglio crearne due di abstract!!!!!)))

now let’s return to the event management page, then click on "call for abstracts" on the left banner, under "organisation" 
click on “manage” on the right of the list of abstracts.

depending on my role, i will see the list of all abstracts and their status.
the options at the top offer customisation possibilities, where we can decide the display criteria of this list.

if you click on the boxes of several abstracts and you have the privileges, you may judge several at once., 

more options are offered on the same line, for example to export the selected abstacts in various document formats (pdf, excell, etc.)
