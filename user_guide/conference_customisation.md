The _Announcement_ section enables you to write an announcement text to be displayed below the _Title_.

Under the _Timetable_ section, you can change your Indico theme style, e.g. to group your Timetable entries by room or to always show a detailed view of the Timetable by default.

In the _Theme_ section, you can select one of the available default colours as your Theme for your Indico pages.
Alternatively, you may upload a css file with your code, so you will be able to completely customise your pages.

Finally, you can upload a **logo** for your event. To do so, click on _Choose from your computer_ or drag and drop the file in the designated area.

### Menu customisation

You can customise the appearance of your indico menus, by clicking on _Menu_, under the tab _Customisation_, while on management mode.

Select _Yes_ on the right so that you can start customising the menus on your pages.

block. Then you can drag and drop the block to change their order and you can click on the pencil to edit the titles of the menu blocks.

To add another block to your Menus you can click on _Add an entry_, then either on _Add link_, or _Add page_.
For example, you can add a page entitled “accommodation” where you will show some photos of hotels, where participants of the conference can stay, and so on.
You can also add a spacer that will separate two blocks, like this…
