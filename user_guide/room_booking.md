Indico Room Booking
```

## Introduction

This chapter describes the Indico module for booking a room for an event.

Indico users can book a room for their conference, meeting or lecture. Bookings can also be standalone - they do not have to be bound to any event. Room managers can monitor and moderate all bookings. Indico administrators can create rooms and manage their data.

This document is a tutorial, navigating through the pages of the room booking modules. It shows you how to assign a room to a particular event or simply to book a room on its own, without attaching it to a event. The booking can then be managed from the administration area.

## Getting into Room Booking Module

Just click on _Room Booking_ in the Indico home page, in the top dark bar. 

![](/assets/main_room.png)



To book rooms for your event, go to the event management page and click on the _Room Booking_ option on the left banner. In both cases you will be asked to sign in. Use your Indico login.

---

### The First Page

The Room Booking Module first page depends on who is logged in. For most people, it shows the site _Map of Rooms_ that can be booked, as per the relevant menu option, on the left banner. The _Book a Room_ option, from the same menu, shows all the bookable rooms sorted by room number, together with the room capacity and equipment available. The _My Bookings_ menu option shows the bookings you have already done. Room managers can see bookings/blockings of rooms they manage by using the _My Rooms / Room Blocking_  options, always on the left banner.

---

### Room Names and filters

When you click on _Book a Room_ on the left banner, the entire list of rooms appears, arithmetically sorted. 
Observe the _filter_ possibilities offered to you on the top row of the table. There you may type a building or room number, if you have a preferred location and restrict your selection to rooms with videoconferencing equipment and/or projector, required capacity and 'privacy' to facilitate your booking process.

The default name is built in the format: "building-floor-room \(location\)". If the room is know by a name, then it appears as: "building-floor-room - Common Name \(location\)".

Examples: "304-1-001 \(CERN\)", "4-3-004 - TH Discussion Room \(CERN\)"

### Three Kinds of Rooms

There are three kinds of rooms. They determine how much freedom users have.

* _Public rooms_ which do not require confirmation \(black/green  
  colour\). This means all bookings are accepted.

* _Public rooms_ which do require confirmation \(orange colour\). You can  
  PRE-book them and wait for acceptance or rejection.

* _Private rooms_ which cannot be booked at all \(red colour\). Only the room manager can book his/her private room. If you need such a room, you should ask this person to create a booking for you.

In the image below you can see examples of these three types of rooms:
* _513-R-068_ is public, i.e. you try to book it, it is free at the time you want it, you have it!
* _513-1-024_ is public but requires confirmation, i.e. you try to book it, it is free at the time you want it, you PRE-book it, wait for moderator's approval, you have it!
* _513-R-070_ is private, i.e. you try to book it, you get the message: _You don't have rights to book this room_

### Booking rooms for single or multiple occurence events

You may reserve a room more than _Once_, namely on a _Daily_, _Weekly_ or _Monthly_ basis. A common example is a weekly meeting \(which takes place at the same time every week\). 

See, on the image below, once you've _selected_ your room and declared you want to book it _Weekly_, how _all Mondays_ appear darker than the other days on the calendar.

### Booking a Room

The booking process consists essentially on three steps:

* Specifying the search criteria
* Selecting an available period
* Confirming the reservation

In the first step you can specify the rooms, date range and time range in which you want to search for bookings. The sections and images shown so far explained how you can select a candidate room to book.

You can use some filters if you want your room to contain certain equipment, such as videoconference, Webcast, Projector, or whether it is a public room.
For example, let’s look for rooms that have Videoconference, and a projector. Please observe the pronounced blue camera and projector images on the _Filter_ top row of the image below. Now only the rooms that have this equipment will appear from which you can try to select one.

![](/assets/indico_rooms_filtered.png)

If you have permission to book the room you selected, you should be able to see, further down in the same page, the _Booking Time & date_ area, that we showed earlier, with a calendar, where you can easily choose the date(s) you want.

If you want to book the room for only one day, simply click on the date you want by choosing the correct month and day.
You will also have to choose the time interval you want to book it for.

If instead you want to book a room for several consecutive days, weeks, or months, click on “Daily, Weekly, or Monthly” near “Frequency”. Hit _Continue_.

On the next page you will see a preview of the room availability for your date\(s\) you specified in your criteria. It looks exactly like the image we showed earlier in the "Kinds of rooms" section.

The green bars inform you on timeslots for which you can book this room, and other bars of other colours will show you when other users have already booked the same room.

If you are trying to book the room for multiple occurences and some of them are impossible, because the room is taken, you can still click on a green bar and _Skip conflicting days_ to proceed with your booking for the rest of the desired period.

Select whether you want to use the room for yourself of if you are booking the room for someone else, and write down the reason for this booking. If you've skipped conflicting days you'll be asked to tick _I understand_ for the slots that cannot be booked.

Finally, if the room is equipped with videoconferencing, select whether you plan to use this equipment or not.

Click on _Create \(pre-\)booking_, once you are finished.

---

### Search and book a room

Let’s now look at how to search for an available room based on more specific criteria.

You can also search for a room based on more specific criteria. For this, click on _Search rooms_ under _Search_.

![](/assets/indico_room_search_all.png)

Write in some room details, such as the name of the person responsible for the room, if you know it, \(e.g. IT secretariat\) or some equipment that you need the room to include. Otherwise leave it blank.
Choose the availability, for example “available”, and decide the time period you want.

Choose the number of seats you want the room to have, and then select the criteria that you want from the extensive list, for example let’s suppose we want _Video conference: Vidyo_

Simply click “Search” once you’re finished and the next page will show you a list of the rooms that match your criteria.

Click on “view” for more details about the room, or click on “\(PRE-\)book”, and you will be directed to the page that allows you to book the room, just like we have seen before.

A "Check conflicts" button is also available on this view, as there might be existing bookings done by others during the period you defined. 

If your booking conflicts with others, you have two options:

* In general, it is better to resolve conflicts manually: by changing dates, hours or maybe trying another room.
* The alternative is to automatically book everything except conflicting days. This may be useful if you do long-term, recurring booking, for example, _whole year, every week_. Imagine everything looks perfect, except for several weeks when the room is not available. In this case check the 'skip conflicting dates' option to book everything except problematic dates.

Another type of search you can do is searching the bookings instead of the room based on certain criteria.
To do this, click on “Search bookings“ on the left banner.

This allows you to look at the bookings other users have made. Narrow down your search to a specific room and/or timespan, to find something suitable to your needs with least tries.

If you want to look at all the bookings for a specific DAY for ALL the rooms, simply click on “Calendar” from the same left banner.


If your form is corectly filled, the system will ensure your new booking does not conflict with others. When no conflicts are found, you will be shown the confirmation page which lists the details of your booking.

* Click _My bookings_ from the menu. Your new booking now appears on the list.

Note: some rooms require confirmation. These rooms are usually coded in orange. In this case, you cannot directly book them. You can only _PRE-book_ such a room. PRE-booking works exactly the same way as booking. The only difference is that you must wait for acceptance from the room manager.

Note: you can always modify your booking \(or PRE-booking\). It will again be checked for conflicts.

Note: you can always browse your own bookings and PRE-bookings using the menu options _My bookings_ and _My PRE-bookings_.

---

### View your Bookings

You can view the bookings or pre-bookings that you made by going under the 'My bookings' sections of the Room Booking side menu:

![](/assets/My_bookings.png)

This page contains all the information about all your bookings, and it allows you to modify, clone or cancel some of them, by clicking on the coloured zone of the booking done. If the room reservation is done for more than a single day, each of the occurences of the booking can be canceled individually. In addition, this page lets you watch the history of the booking \(e.g. the image below continues through a long list of reservations done for room 513-R-068 since 2013 and up to now.\)

![](/assets/booking_history.png)

---

### Blocking a Room

As a room manager you may create room blockings which prevent regular users from booking certain rooms. This feature can be used for special events during which only a few people should be allowed to create bookings for some rooms.

To create such a blocking, go to 'Block rooms' in the Room Booking side menu and follow these steps:

* Choose the period during which the rooms should be blocked by clicking the start and end date on the calendars.
* Enter a reason for the blocking - it will be displayed to users trying to book one of the blocked rooms.
* Add some rooms to the 'Rooms' list. Those will be affected by the blocking.
* Unless you want to be the only one to be able to book the blocked rooms, you can add other users or groupe to the "Allowed users/groups" list.
* Submit the blocking after confirming that the chosen period is correct. Once you have created the blocking, the dates cannot be changed.

When trying to book a blocked room, users in the 'Allowed users/groups' list will see that the room is blocked and the reason why but will be able to create bookings anyway. You as the creator of the blocking will always be able to override your blocking, so you don't have to add yourself to the list. The same applies to the owners of blocked rooms. They will see the blocking and a warning that the room has been blocked, but they are able to override the blocking.

You can also create blockings for rooms you don't own. These blockings will have to be approved be the respective owners - until they do so, other users trying to create a booking on that room will see the pending blocking request but will be able to carry on with their booking.

As soon as the blocking for a room has been approved \(blockings for your own rooms are immediately approved when creating the blocking\), all bookings colliding with the blocking are automatically rejected.

## Core Features and Constraints

### Introduction

This section describes core capabilities and constraints of the Room Booking Module. It may be useful to assess whether it meets your needs.

Note that the Room Booking Module is NOT supposed to be a general-purpose "room management" or "room booking" software.

It was built with conference rooms in mind. Its main purpose is to make conference organization easier. We see room booking as a part of conference organization \(but it is possible to book rooms without associating the booking to an event\).

---

### Core Features

#### General

General features are:

* Stand-alone and "in-conference" mode.
  * The stand-alone mode allows you to book, manage bookings and do administration stuff. You don't have to create an Indico event \(the bookings will not be assigned to any Indico event\).
  * The "In-conference" mode allows you to book rooms for your event. You can assign booked rooms to conferences, lectures, meetings, sessions, contributions or breaks.
* Recurring bookings \('every day', 'every week', 'every 3rd Wednesday of a month', etc\).
* E-mail notifications \(to users and room managers, about every important action\).
* Three user roles: \(1\) Indico administrator, \(2\) room manager and
  \(3\) ordinary user.
* Optional booking moderation. Each room may work in one of the following modes:
  * Bookings require explicit confirmation of room manager, _or_
  * Bookings are automatically accepted.

---

#### User

Options available to regular users:

* Book a room
* Manage own bookings \(track, modify, clone, cancel\)
* Search for rooms
* Search for bookings \(including archival\)
* View existing room blockings

---

#### Room Manager

In addition to what a user has access to, a room manager can:

* Accept and reject PRE-bookings \(for his room\(s\)\)
* Reject bookings \(for his room\(s\)\)
* Block rooms from being booked \(with confirmation from the room owner\)
* Accept blocking requests \(for his room\(s\)\)

---

#### Indico Administrator

In addition to what a room manager has access to, an Indico Administrator can:

* Switch on/off Room Booking Module
* Configure room booking plugins in admin section
* Add/remove location
* Define room attributes specific to the location
* Define possible room equipment specific to the location
* Manage meeting rooms \(add/modify/remove\)

---

### Constraints

The room must have its manager. It is not possible to define multiple managers for a single room \(you can work around this by creating an Indico account shared by several people\).

The room must have a defined building, which must be a number. This is mandatory. If you do not need building, put any number there \(like '0'\). If your building naming scheme has letters, we are sorry - the software is not flexible enough for you.

The room must have defined floor \(alphanumerical\) and room 'number' \(alphanumerical in fact\).

Restrictions may apply to the time period for which you are allowed to define a periodic booking, e.g. you may book the same room every day at the same time but not for more than X weeks/months.

---

## Dictionary

_Room_: meeting or conference room. Please note that the software is not suitable for managing other rooms, like offices, corridors, etc.

_Location_: physical location of rooms. Room custom attributes and possible equipment are defined on a location basis. Example: rooms at CERN may have different attributes and different equipment than rooms in Fermilab.

_Booking_: final reservation of a room. While considered final, it still may be rejected in case of emergency.

_PRE-booking_: unconfirmed reservation of a room. PRE-booking is subject to acceptance or rejection.

_Room responsible/manager_: the person who accepts/rejects bookings. Each room has exactly one person responsible. A person may be responsible for any number of rooms.

_Room blocking_: a restriction created by a room manager which prevents users from booking the rooms listed in the blocking unless they have explicit permission to override the permission or own the rooms.
