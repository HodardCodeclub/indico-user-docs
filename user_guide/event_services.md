### Service request

The event manager will find a form to be filled with the selected options for the requested service. Once the request is submitted, it will be marked as pending awaiting for approval of the service administrator. At any moment in the meantime the request can be modified or withdrawn. Upon reply from a service manager, the service request issuer will receive a notification email.
