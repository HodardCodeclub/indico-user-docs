Categories
==========

What is an indico category
--------

A Category is a means of grouping your events or other Categories together. In Indico, *Home* is the top level category from where you start.

Inside a category you can:

-   add/delete events or other sub-categories,
-   set access rights to say who can access or modify,
-   re-allocate the sub-categories,
-   remove the sub-categories,
-   delete the current category and everything inside it,
-   and also insert a logo and a description in your own category.

You cannot have a category that contains both sub-categories and events. You will have to use the "split" functionality (the button with a "bifurcated" arrow) to move the contents of the category to one or more sub-categories.

These features are accessible through the menu *Manage category* (you must be logged in and with management rights in the category in order to see it), that you can find to the right of your own category title. After clicking on *Manage Category* you will be accessing the Management area for Category.

Specifically for the *Calendar* view, which gives you an overview of all the events over several months, see an example from the CERN Home Category in the image below.

You can move to past and future months from the calendar on the left banner and show the details for your category. Example:

### Detail Modification & Sub-Category/Event Organisation

The details of a Category can be modified and sub-categories can be organised from the option *General settings* in the management area. Details can be modified by clicking on *modify* inside the main menu. Sub-categories and events can be organised in the particular order in which you wish to view them by using the order drop down box next to each sub-category.

You can re-allocate a sub-category or event by selecting the one you wish to move using the tick box and clicking on re-allocate, you will then be asked to where you would like to reallocate this sub-category/event.

To remove a sub-category and anything it contains or an event, select it and click *remove*. If it contains anything you will be asked confirmation of the deletion.

### Protection

From the Management Area you can protect your category in terms of who can view it, who is its manager and who can create events in the category.

*Manager(s)* can be added to a category to allow access to the Management Area for modification. Category managers are either those listed in the category protection view or Indico administrators. The creator of a category will be able to modify it without being listed.

*Protection mode*: A category can be:
**Public**: Anyone can view events in it, or
**Inheriting**: The protection mode of the parent category (see breadcrumbs under the page top banner) applies, or
**Protected**: Only those users in the *Access control list* or administrators can access the category. 

When a Category has 'Inheriting' or 'Protected' mode, the manager(s) can put a text of contact information to be shows to non-authorised viewers, so users with no access will know who to contact in order to request access. 

Important note for the 'Inheriting' protection mode: Changing the parent's protection will change the protection of its sub-categories.

*Event visibility*: This is **not** related to category *viewing* rights - those are regulated by the *Protection mode* explained above.  The choice offered, allows you to decide whether events in this category will be shown in *Today's events* and the *Calendar* from everywhere or from some parent categories only.

*Event creation settings*: You can restrict who is able to add events to the category. If you do so, you will need to add users or groups to the list in order to allow them to add events.
