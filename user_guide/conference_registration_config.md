As event manager, enter the event management area  and click on _Registration_ on the left banner. As you can see, payments are disabled by default.

To change this, simply click on _Enable payments_, and _Confirm_.
At this point, a button called _Payments_ will appear on the left banner. Click on this button to see several payment options. Click on one of the payments options available to enable it, e.g. choose the _Bank transfer_ option, in which case you will have to select _Enable_, and insert the IBAN code of the bank account where the payment should be deposited.
you can do the same for other options such as PayPal, using the PayPal ID you needed for the Conference payment.

### Other Registration configuration steps

From the _Registration_ page of the event management area, click on the _Create form_ button.

Give a _Name_ to your registration form. The most important of the options available is the _Moderation workflow_ option. If, as a Conference event manager, you select the option _Moderated_, this means that the manager has to approve any user registration first.

It is important to select the "registration modification allowed" option, because of the electronic payment features. it is wise to allow modifications only until the payment or simply say “never”.
this is because change of 'settings' after payment may entail change of the total due amount.



then, in price options, select the currency and enter the fee.

further down you may configure notification headers and text for emails to be sent to the registrants and to the event managers.

 click save when you are finished!


at the right of the “registration form” row, click on “configure”. there is a form by default.
you can add sections to this form, by clicking on "add new" at the top and then "section".
for example:"accommodation", click on "add".

   then click on the “+” sign, in your section and select the "accomodation" option. 

on caption, write “accommodation”. 
go to “configuration” on the left banner, and select a few dates available.
then go to “edit accomodations“ on the left banner.
the default option is 'no accomodation', but you can add more. 
click on “add new accomodation“. for example “cern hostel“, enter the room price and places' limit.
 and then click on “add”.

remember that you can add all sorts of fields. by clicking on the “+” signs of the sections defined. 

the sections are drag and drop!

then click on “back” at the bottom of the page on the right.
