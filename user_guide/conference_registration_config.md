These steps in detail:

### Enable payments

As event manager, enter the event management area  and click on Registration on the left banner. As you can see, payments are disabled by default.

# NEED PICTURE HERE 


To change this, simply click on _Enable payments_, and _Confirm_.
once it’s enabled, a button called “payments” will appear on the left banner.

click on the payments button.

here you have several payment options available 

you need to click on one of the payments option to enable it. for example click on the “bank transfer” option.

here you will have to select “enable”, and insert the iban code required for the payment (????????????????????).

you can do the same for other options such as paypal, using the paypal id you need for your payment.

================================


let’s now return to our registration page, by clicking on “registration”, on the left banner.

the registration module contains several configuration options. the most important one, is the create form!... click on this button.




give a name to your registration form.
here there are a few options, but the most important is the moderation workflow option.
as a conference event manager i select the option: moderated. this means that the manager has to approve any user registration first.


here, it is important to select the "registration modification allowed" option, because of the electronic payment features. it is wise to allow modifications only until the payment or simply say “never”.
this is because change of 'settings' after payment may entail change of the total due amount.



then, in price options, select the currency and enter the fee.

further down you may configure notification headers and text for emails to be sent to the registrants and to the event managers.

 click save when you are finished!


at the right of the “registration form” row, click on “configure”. there is a form by default.
you can add sections to this form, by clicking on "add new" at the top and then "section".
for example:"accommodation", click on "add".

   then click on the “+” sign, in your section and select the "accomodation" option. 

on caption, write “accommodation”. 
go to “configuration” on the left banner, and select a few dates available.
then go to “edit accomodations“ on the left banner.
the default option is 'no accomodation', but you can add more. 
click on “add new accomodation“. for example “cern hostel“, enter the room price and places' limit.
 and then click on “add”.

remember that you can add all sorts of fields. by clicking on the “+” signs of the sections defined. 

the sections are drag and drop!

then click on “back” at the bottom of the page on the right.

============ as an event manager ======
============ let’s now look on how to manage invitations ===============

from the event management page, click on "manage" on the 'invitations' row.

here a list of people that will receive an email invitation to the event can be defined. the email will contain a link to the indico registration form for the event. 
they either accept or decline the invitation.






click on invite, you can either invite indico users, or non existing users.
search and add the users you want to invite. ((((((show multiple users being selected)))))



/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

if you want to accept the registration of the users you send the invitations to right away without the need for a confirmation first, you can select “yes”, on “skip moderation”.
click on “send” once you’re finished.
