These steps in detail:

============= (((((as a user))))) ======================================

============== let’s now see how you can register or apply as a candidate participant ===================


now, as a user, candidate conference participant, we will place a registration,,,,,,,, or an application, depending on whether participation to the event is moderated or not.

on the event overview page,
click apply now.

the user will fill out the form, for example, in our case, the cern hostel for accomodation, the arrival and the departure date.

click on apply once you’re finished.


here we see the registration is awating approval. this is because we have enabled the moderation option at the beginning, which means that a manager will have to approve the registration first.




============ ((((as an event manager))))) =============

============== let’s now approve applications as an event manager ===================


switching to a different role again, from applicant to event manager. click at the pencil at the top to return to your management page.

then, click on registration at the left banner, under organisation, and as a manager, click on “registrations”.
see the   still pending registration.

simply click on the name of the applicant, and click on approve to approve the registration.
((((as a user)))))


once the event manager has approved the application. the user will be able to place the payment.
as a user, on the page that will appear after having filled the application form, a checkout button will appear at the bottom. 
you will be directed to a page where you will be able to pay with the options enabled, in our case, bank transfer and paypal.
