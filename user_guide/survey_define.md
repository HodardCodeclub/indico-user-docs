Create the questionnaire
--------------------------

To do this, click on _Manage_, and then on _Prepare questionnaire_. 

You can either import an existing questionnaire, or define a new one.

You may  divide your questionnaire in sections. _Sections_ contain
_questions_ and questions will show up within the corresponding section, except for those in the "_standalone section_", which will show up at the top level.

For each question, you can choose a different modality, such as multiple choice, a 'yes' or 'no' answer, and so on.

While creating a new section, by clicking on _Add section_, decide whether you want a standard section, or a standalone one.

Type in the title of your section, for example "Usefulness" and a brief description "How useful is this tutorial?"

Click on “Save” and the section will be displayed.

Time to add some items to your section.

You can click on “add text item” if your want to include an item that only contains your informative text.
Otherwise you can add one of the actual questions that the survey participant will have to answer.

Click on “add text item”, and write "Welcome! Please answer this question" in the box. Click on “Save” in order to show the text item in your section.

This means that the user will be able to select only ONE from the available options.

Type the question in the title box,for example "Will you use indico to make your own survey?" and add an additional description if you need to, for example: "Select one of the candidate answers below", then indicate whether you want the answer to this question to be required in order for the survey to be effectively submitted.

Select whether you want your options to be displayed as radio buttons or a dropdown list.
If you choose radio buttons, indicate whether you want them displayed horizontally or vertically.

Type in the options that you want your participant to choose from, for example, 'yes', 'no, 'maybe' and click on Save once you are finished.
